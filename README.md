# Smart-Park

   This project was created within a timespan of 6 months during my Undergraduation 

   This is an Android based application that automates the paid parking systems in India with an Internet based parking slot booking. This application involves scanning of QR Codes at the entry and exit level of parking slot. The goal of this application is to reduce the existing man power and long wait in the queues for parking.


   The Smart Park folder contains two folders "MyApplication1" and "System" that contains application code for the user and system admin of parking lot.
